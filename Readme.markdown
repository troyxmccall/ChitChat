Allows you to receive notification center notifications for new messages, and adds some useful keyboard shortcuts:

| Feature                                        | Shortcut  |
|------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| Start a new conversation                       | ⌘N        |
| Search past conversations                      | ⌘F        |
| Jump to your 1st .. 9th most recent converation| ⌘1 .. ⌘9  |
| Scroll through your conversations              | ↑ and ↓   |

Inspired by, and in small part based on, [Messenger for Mac](http://fbmacmessenger.rsms.me/), created by [Rasmus Andersson](https://twitter.com/rsms). ChitChat uses some code from this project.

##Feature Support

Most features of WhatsApp Web are currently supported, and support for the remainder is being actively developed:

| Feature                                 | Working?  |
|-----------------------------------------|-----------|
| Text chat                               | YES       |
| Attached media viewing                  | YES       |
| Attached media downloading              | YES       |
| Notification center notifications       | YES       |
| Media uploading                         | NO\*       |
| Media recording (using camera + mic.)   | NO        |

\*Media uploading **is** supported when dragging the image/video file into the app's window. Uploading using the upload button is currently not supported, since WKWebView provides no easy mechanism for using `<input type="file">` tags.

##Note

This project does **not** attempt to reverse engineer the WhatsApp API or attempt to reimplement any part of the WhatsApp client's communications with the WhatsApp servers.

Any communication between the user and WhatsApp servers is handled by WhatsApp Web itself; this is merely a native wrapper for WhatsApp Web, more akin to a clone of Safari than of any WhatsApp software.
